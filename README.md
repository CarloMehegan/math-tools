### 5.1 Estimating Area
Jan. 27, 2020

This program is a calculator used to approximate the area under a line using rectangles.

Is LOVE2D the best medium for this? No, but it works.

To use the calculator, you tweak f(x) to the expression needed, then input the interval and number of rectangles used to calculate the area. Then, pressing the calculate button will show three approximations: Right-endpoint, left-endpoint, and midpoint approximation.
